            <h2>About Vincent van Gogh</h2>
            <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853â€“1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter known for his expressive and emotive use of color and brushwork.  
               Despite struggling with mental health issues and financial difficulties, he created over 2,100 artworks, including the famous  
               <em>Starry Night</em>, <em>Sunflowers</em>, and <em>The Bedroom</em>. His work significantly influenced modern art,  
               though he only gained recognition after his death.</p>
